Blahtexml version 0.4.4
======================================

Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex to allow it to process an entire
XML file, and to convert each blahtex equation in it into MathML equations.
Blahtexml is a source-level extension of blahtex, which means that anything
that works with Blahtex also works with blahtexml.

Blahtexml requires Xerces-C 2.x to be installed. If you do not have Xerces-C
installed, you will not be able to build blahtexml (but you will still be able
to builld and use blahtex of course).

Blahtexml is also licensed under the GNU General Public License.
See the file "GNU-GPL" and the source code for more details.

Brief build instructions (more details in the manual): run one of

  make blahtexml-linux
  make blahtexml-mac
